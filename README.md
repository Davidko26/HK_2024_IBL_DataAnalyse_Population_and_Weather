# HK_2024_IBL_DataAnalyse_Population_and_Weather

## Inspiration
Work with data and try to make some interesting analyses about weather.
## What it does
It can consider the effect of growing population to weather conditions like temperature and snowing.
## How we built it
We have used PHP to handling data and to work with data and SQL to save data to database.
## Challenges we ran into
Download and process a really big API was the biggest challenge. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It is exciting to see graphs and a little dependency of population to weather .
## What we learned
We have improved our skills with work with data and we've have to work with interesting but big datasets.
## What's next for Analyses of foreign effects on parameters of weather
It would be interesting to see effects of population to another parameters of weather.
